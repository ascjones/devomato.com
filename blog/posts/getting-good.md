I recently reread <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/" target="_blank">Cal Newport's</a> excellent career advice book: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you" target="_blank">So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love</a>. The central thesis is that in order to build a remarkable and fulfilling career you must focus on building 'rare and valuable' skills, rather than the popular advice to simply 'follow your passion'.

I'm currently taking sabbatical from work, after having worked full time for going on 10 years since I graduated from university...time flies! Along with taking some R & R and enjoying the South African summertime, my major focus will be building some skills and have some fun geeking out a little bit. So many cool and interesting things to learn about: and now I have the time, so time to make a plan. First to brainstorm areas I want to work on, then later I will narrow things down and get more specific.

### Programming Languages

Good developers are not restricted to a single language/framework, and becoming fluent in other languages will not only add extra golf clubs to my bag but exposes me to different concepts and technology that might be transferable.

- __F#__ (my level: _intermediate_): my favourite language at the moment: dive deep into some advanced language features, build a non trivial app
- __Javascript__ (my level: _intermediate_): build a 'real time' web app with full stack javascript (node.js on server)
- __Python__ (my level: _beginner_): written a few small scripts with it already, but learn the language properly: build a web app.
- __Go__ (my level: _complete beginner_): cool systems langauge from Google: learn the fundamentals, build something interesting (and fast!)
- __C#__ (my level: _advanced_): this has been my primary professional language for my 10 year career. Still lots to learn though! Create or contribute to an OSS project.

### How stuff works

Building anything other than the most trivial system well requires a good understanding of how things work behind the abstractions and APIs. And modern systems are usually distributed and require some sort of persistence. I've been reading around these areas for a while - time to really wrap my head around it:

- **Databases**: the use of NoSql databases and storage engines has taken off - I want to get under the covers and understand that stuff: Log Structured Merge, Memory Mapped Files etc. 
- **Distributed Algorithms**: e.g. Paxos

### Things to build

At the end of the day the job of a developer is to build stuff that works and does a job, and this part is probably the most satisfying. So to bring it back from the theoretical to the concrete I will make sure to be creating semi-useful applications. Definitions are vague at the moment, but it's a start.

- **A blog**: you're reading it, needs some work though.
- **A mobile app**: good skill to have!
- **A 'real-time' web app**: pushing data from the server to the client
- **A sample app using Event Sourcing with the EventStore**: I dig the EventStore - want to play with it some more.

## The Plan

Next step is prioritise and prune this lot, then get more specific for each point about what I want to achieve. Then I can assign the amount of time I want to spend on each area and work out a schedule, fitting it around my beach time. It's a start!
