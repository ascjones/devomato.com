# Getting good

I recently reread <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/" target="_blank">Cal Newport's</a> excellent career advice book: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you" target="_blank">So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love</a>. The central thesis is that in order to build a remarkable and fulfilling career you must focus on building 'rare and valuable' skills, rather than the popular advice to simply 'follow your passion'.

I'm currently taking sabbatical from work, after having worked full time for going on 10 years since I graduated from university...time flies! Along with taking some R & R and enjoying the South African summertime, my major focus will be building some skills and have some fun geeking out a little bit. So many cool and interesting things to learn about: and now I have the time, so time to make a plan. First to brainstorm areas I want to work on, then later I will narrow things down and get more specific.

### Programming Languages

Good developers are not restricted to a single language/framework, and becoming fluent in other languages not only adds extra golf clubs to your bag but exposes you to different concepts and technology that might be transferable.

- **F#** (intermediate): dive deep into some advanced language features, build a non trivial app
- **Javascript** (intermediate): build a non trivial 'real time' web app with full stack javascript (node.js on server)
- **Python** (beginner): learn the language properly, build a web app.
- **Go** (complete beginner): learn the fundamentals, build something interesting.
- **C#** (advanced): create or contribute to an OSS project.

### How stuff works

TODO: Why I want to learn how stuff works

- **Databases**: the use of NoSql databases and storage engines has taken off - I want to get under the covers and understand that stuff
- **Distributed Algorithms**: e.g. Paxos

### Things to build

TODO: Why I want to build stuff

- **A blog**: you're reading it, needs some work though.
- **A mobile app**: good skill to have!
- **A 'real-time' web app**: pushing data from the server to the client

TODO: Summary: next step make a plan of action!
